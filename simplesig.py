# Version: 1.3.37 (revision 1.2)
# Description: Create very simple YARA rules from a keyword list
# Intended Use: Create a YARA rule with keywords for your forensic
# exam to find where these keywords exist in RAM using the "yarascan"
# plugin. This is a very simple string manipulation script that takes
# a text file (one keyword per line) as input and outputs a plaintext 
# YARA signature.

# Tested on OSX && Python 2.7

import sys
import os

# Simple validation that there is a valid text file as command line argument.
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print "Please run again with a text file as command line argument."
    sys.exit()
try:
    os.path.isfile(sys.argv[1])

    print "Please run again with a text file as command line argument."
